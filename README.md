Project Name: IM Portfolio & 30-minute Film Festival (30FF)

Project Description:
At this initial phase, this project mainly focuses on 30FF presentation. It consists of the main portfolio page that will be used to present all the projects we will be doing throught the semester. For now, 30FF is the only available one. Once you reach the 30FF homepage, you are able to visit other different related pages, such as Team, Behind the Scenes, you are able to watch the movie my team and I created for this specific purpose. There is also the Contact page that has some of my social media links as well as the email address. The overall concept is to reflect the festival. The theme is focused on black and bright pink so the users can associate it with the cinema experience. The story of our film is 'What Do People Do?' in 2020 Quarantine. For the title I used the font that resembles a hand-writing. Since the movie trully portrates what we have been doing in the isolation/quarantile in this global covid pandemic, I included behind the scenes page that tells people, in a fun way, that there was no acting in the movie - since it's the real representation of us. I used black background most of the time to really grab attention on the letters, text and the movie itself. Without other distractions, and the black screen, it feels like being in a cinema in way. And people do miss cinemas, at least I do. Moreover, feel free to read the short biographies of our team.

Process:
The project is live on Github pages and can be found here: https://nadja0607.github.io/
During the process, I watched lots of YouTube videos to get an idea and to improve my knowledge about the web-development. I definitely think that class material was super helpful.

Reflection/Evaluation: The initial concept was to make a bright neon color page with a navigation system within the same page. However I liked the final idea better. My expectations were to have a webpage that presents the work of my team on this short movie. I didn't really have much of html/css experience before so I really enjoed the making process and I think I definitely improved my knowledge. I know I'm not the world's most creative person, but I was happy to see that I was able to build this final working version and connect my different pages together. It was enjoyable to work with JavaScript as I could see how we can actually interact with the whole html file, the style itself and make the web interactive. I'd say my goals and expectations are met but I'd like to learn more about how to make it fully responsive.
