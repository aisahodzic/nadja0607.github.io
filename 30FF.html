                within
                months. Nobody predicted that it would kill so many people, force countries to lockdown, shut schools
                and
                public places and put our life on hold. It hit us and now it's everywhere. It made the whole world
                bleed,
                spreading like wildfire.

                    to capture, in a funny and playful way, different things people do while in quarantine and inside
                    their
                    homes. Simply said, we just thought of the things we usually do every day and put them together. The
                    goal: we want everybody to know that weâ€™re all in this TOGETHER.
