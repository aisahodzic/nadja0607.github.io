                <p>Hi there! I'm Vee, a sophomore studying CS and Interactive Media at NYU Abu Dhabi. As both a coder
                    and debater, I'm fascinated by the various intersections between STEM and the social sciences. I
                    have experience in full-stack development, data science, and physical computing, and I'm currently
                    looking to learn more about AI/ML, design, and computational modelling. I believe deeply in the
                    power of tech for social good, so I hope to help people and better communities with my knowledge in
                    STEM!</p>

                    developed a new hobby in music and am trying to teach myself how to play the ukulele. I spend most
                    of my time studying, eating and sleeping.</p>
