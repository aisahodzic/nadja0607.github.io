                <p style="padding: none;">Hi, I'm Nadja, an undergraduate at NYU AD with expertise in Computer
                    Science, Software / Web Development and Economics. I've always loved to solve puzzles and the
                    logical and creative
                    thinking that goes into them. Being a person with many different interests including sports and
                    languages, although sometimes it seemed impossible to make those fields overlap, Computer Science
                    was and is my way to achieve this while inventing and building solutions. Being highly motivated to
                    learn and
                    work in a dynamic environment, where I can easily acquire knowledge and apply the acquired one, I
                    enjoy being a part of a team, as it is a good way to maximize efficiency and achieve goals. In
                    addition to my studies, I have been dancing Latin American dances including salsa and bachata since
                    a very early age. Moreover, in my free time, I enjoy playing the violin, hiking and traveling.</p>

                <p>Hello, I am Ansh Kachalia, a sophomore, studying Economics at NYUAD. Apart from my academic
                    interests, I enjoy playing cricket and am a part of the intercollegiate team. Recently, i have
                    developed a new hobby in music and am trying to teach myself how to play the ukulele. I spend most
                    of my time studying, eating and sleeping.</p>

                <p>Hi there! I'm Vee, a sophomore studying CS and Interactive Media at NYU Abu Dhabi. As both a coder
                    and debater, I'm fascinated by the various intersections between STEM and the social sciences. I
                    have experience in full-stack development, data science, and physical computing, and I'm currently
                    looking to learn more about AI/ML, design, and computational modelling. I believe deeply in the
                    power of tech for social good, so I hope to help people and better communities with my knowledge in
                    STEM!</p>
